## About This Project: 

What the application does: This is a basic to-do-list deployed on Heroku that allows the user to add "to-do-list" items and tick the checkbox to rule off the tasks that were done, as well as render the current day.

Motivation Behind Creation: This project was created with the intent to understand the EJS Express Framework for templating and layouts.

Key Learning Points Included:
- Understood the concept of JavaScript Scopes & Declarations (Var/Let/Const)
- Learnt about the existence of templating & layouts with the EJS framework.
- Passing data input from the user by a POST Request and then updating this to the backend server.
- Learnt about creating external modules when re-factoring code to reduce the amount of clutter in the main JavaScript file that is used as the entry point.

Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js 
- Nodemon (Node Package) - Monitors changes in your sourcecode and automatically restarts server for faster local development.
- Body Parser (Node Package) - Used to parse incoming request bodies to allow for POST Requests to be made to the backend server.
- Heroku - to deploy the application on the internet.
